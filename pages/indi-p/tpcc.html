                    The Agronomy Center at Terrace Park Country Club is a thoughtfully 
                    designed maintenance and operations hub that supports the daily 
                    needs of a premier golf course. Located between holes 7 and 8, the 
                    facility balances functionality with seamless integration into the 
                    scenic Little Miami River landscape. The design addresses operational 
                    efficiency, sustainability, and long-term durability while minimizing 
                    visual impact on the surrounding course.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The program includes workshops, equipment storage, administrative 
                    offices, break rooms, and an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) 
                    building with a chemical mixing room and wash bay. These spaces 
                    are strategically arranged to optimize workflows, enhance safety, 
                    and support future growth. The design incorporates a central 
                    courtyard, offering efficient access for vehicles ranging from turf 
                    sprayers to 56-foot articulated trucks.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Sustainability is a cornerstone of the project, featuring green 
                    roofs for thermal insulation and stormwater management, photovoltaic 
                    arrays for renewable energy generation, and rainwater harvesting 
                    systems for equipment washing and greenhouse irrigation. Durable 
                    materials such as precast concrete panels and polished concrete 
                    floors ensure low maintenance while harmonizing with the natural 
                    surroundings.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Compliant with Ohio Building Code, OSHA, EPA, and golf industry 
                    best practices, the facility exemplifies operational excellence 
                    and environmental stewardship. This project embodies a commitment 
                    to sustainability and efficiency, seamlessly blending form and 
                    function to enhance the Terrace Park Country Club experience.
