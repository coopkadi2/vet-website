                    Von Euw Tetrault is proud to be the architect for the key structures 
                    in Findlay’s new Civic Park, a transformative project designed to 
                    serve as a vibrant community hub and address critical flooding 
                    concerns along the Blanchard River. This park represents a 
                    significant investment in both infrastructure and public space, 
                    emerging from a broader benching project aimed at mitigating flood 
                    risks while enhancing the riverfront’s utility and appeal.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Our scope includes three major pavilions and a signature 
                    amphitheater. The pavilions are thoughtfully designed to house 
                    essential community programs, providing restrooms, concessions, and 
                    storage to support a wide variety of events and daily activities. 
                    The design of the pavilions intentionally breaks down the larger 
                    roofs and massing typically seen in traditional park shelters, 
                    creating a variety of spaces and scales under and around the 
                    structures. This approach accommodates different group sizes and 
                    event types, offering a range of experiences for park visitors, 
                    from intimate gatherings to larger community events.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The amphitheater serves as the central focal point of the park and 
                    has been conceived to address a common issue in park design—the 
                    underutilization of amphitheater spaces. By shaping the base and 
                    canopy of the amphitheater with flexibility in mind, the design 
                    accommodates a broad range of uses, seamlessly connecting the park 
                    with the city and the river. This ensures that the amphitheater 
                    remains an active, engaging space that fosters community gatherings, 
                    performances, and other events throughout the year.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The structures and their integration into the park reflect a 
                    commitment to adaptability, sustainability, and enhancing the 
                    connection between Findlay’s urban core and its natural environment, 
                    setting a new benchmark for civic spaces in the region.
