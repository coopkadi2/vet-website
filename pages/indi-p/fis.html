                    <br/>
                    The Innovation Hub at the University of Cincinnati is a 12,000-square-foot prototyping 
                    and micro-factory facility is a space for research, exploration, and creation of new 
                    ideas, objects, and products. It is outfitted with a broad array of tools from traditional 
                    to state of the art â€“ including high-performing 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC router, 
                    and a water-jet cutter.  F.I.S. became a corporate partner in 2019 with the goal of using 
                    the 1819 space to host co-op students and new projects in fin-tech innovation.

                    The project reimagines a 3,000 sq-ft office/workshop for our client. The space is single aspect, 
                    with daylight only entering from the east facade. This presented a unique problem when trying 
                    to design a highly functioning office environment that included not only open plan office space 
                    but also a series of meeting rooms and private work spaces. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The concept for the interior was a series of partitions made of perforated metal mesh. The 
                    mesh allowed for light transmission deep into the volume while simultaneously allowing for 
                    the division of spaces and privacy. The level of perforation was tuned space to space 
                    depending on its need for privacy and connectivity back to the open office.
