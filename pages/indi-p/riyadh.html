                    von Euw Tetrault completed the Airport Park competition in the 
                    spring of 2020 along with X-Architects of Dubai and Land of Milan. 
                    Our team was responsible for the architectural design and assisted 
                    in the masterplanning of the site.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The competition brief called for a series of mixed-use, high-density 
                    districts across the 300-acre site, with each district being anchored 
                    by a “theme.” The four districts were housing, entertainment, office, 
                    and culture.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Our initial architecture strategy was to develop a unique collection 
                    of buildings that seemingly rose from the existing desert landscape, 
                    recalling found objects in archaeology/geology. The buildings would 
                    become containers for landscape experimentation and program and would 
                    link the new site development to the natural desert site.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The buildings would also provide shelter for the proposed botanical 
                    garden, allowing the full diversity of Saudi landscapes to be put on 
                    display for visitors to view and interact with.
